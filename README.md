# Welcome to HelpToSave

We are Mischa and Selim, activists supporting small grassroots initiatives all around the world and we would like to collaborate with you!. 

We support small initiatives with quick and "bureaucratically uncomplicated" help.

Please consider supporting small projects instead of large NGOs which are already getting a lot of help. 

We have personal contacts with these initiatives, they are friends or friends of friends. These initiatives need money to maintain their projects, buy food and medicine, for cleaning and organizational expenses, etc. The money that we provide is not used for the staff, and they can provide bills, photos and videos to show where the money goes and to show that the initiatives are active. We of course also provide proof that the money was transferred.


## HelpToSave Planet Earth
Supporting new small climate change initiatives so they can have a greater impact and bring new ideas.

## HelpToSave Human Rights
We find initiatives who are fighting for human rights and we help them as much as we can.

## HelpToSave Animals
We support self-organized animal shelters, mainly in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. 

## HelpToSave Food
We collect food using different platforms like foodsharing, sirplus, tafel, etc. to give it to people who need it. We also organize large dinner events to cook with the food we collected.

## HelpToSave Yourself
We are constantly on the look for initiatives who help disadvantaged people to deal with issues in their lives, ranging from social, mental, bureaucratic, health, etc. issues
